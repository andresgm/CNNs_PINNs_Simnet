# CNNs_PINNs_Simnet

This repository contains three different folders: <br/>
<br/>
-- **CNNs**: Files used to train the convolutional neural network. <br/>
-- **PINNs**: Files used to train the physics informed convolutional neural network. <br/>
-- **SimNet**: Files used in SimNet. <br/>
<br/>
The architectures presented in the folder /cnns/Models and /pinns/Models were taken from: Mateus  Dias  Ribeiro,  Abdul  Rehman,  Sheraz  Ahmed, and  Andreas  Dengel.   Deepcfd:   Efficient  steady-state laminar  flow  approximation  with  deep  convolutional neural networks.  2020. https://github.com/mdribeiro/DeepCFD
